Guidelines: 

1. No variable should hold a reference to a concrete class
    * Note: If you use new, you’ll be holding a reference to a concrete class. Use a factory to get around that!
2. No class should derive from a concrete class
    * Note: If you derive from a concrete class, you’re depending on a concrete class. Derive from an abstraction, like an interface or an abstract class.
3. No method should override an implemented method of any of its base classes.
